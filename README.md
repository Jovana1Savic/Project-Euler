# Project Euler

This folder contains solutions to problems from Hacker Rank's Project Euler competition. Hacker Rank problems are usually a generalization of the corresponding problem on Project Euler with more strict time and memory constraints, therefore a bit more difficult. Solutions to actual Project Euler problem can be obtained by runnning the program with right input or, not as often, by modifying the given solution (when needed these modifications are trivial).
